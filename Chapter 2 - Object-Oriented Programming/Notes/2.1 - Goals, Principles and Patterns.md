Object-Oriented Paradigm:
  - Actors: Objects
  - Objects are instances of classes.
  - Classes provide a concise and consistent view of objects without revealing inner workings.
  - Class Definition:
    - Specifies instance variables (data members).
    - Specifies methods (member functions) for object execution.
  - Goals and Design Principles:
    - Fulfilment of various goals and design principles discussed in this chapter.

# 2.1.1 - Object-Oriented Design Goals
Software implementations should achieve robustness, adaptability, and reusability.
## Robustness
- Software Development Goals:
  - Correctness:
    - Program produces correct output for all anticipated inputs.
  - Robustness:
    - Ability to handle unexpected inputs gracefully.
    - Critical in life-critical applications to prevent injury or loss of life.
- Example:
  - Therac-25 accidents in the late 1980s.
  - Radiation-therapy machine overdosed six patients due to software errors.
  - Highlighted the importance of robust software in critical systems.
## Adaptability
- Modern Software Applications:
  - Examples: Web browsers, Internet search engines.
  - Large programs used over many years.
- Goals of Quality Software:
  - Adaptability (Evolvability):
    - Ability to evolve over time in response to changing environmental conditions.
  - Portability:
    - Ability to run with minimal change on different hardware and operating system platforms.
- Advantage of Python:
  - Portability provided by the language itself.
## Reusability
- Reusability:
  - Desire for software to be reusable.
  - Same code usable as a component in different systems and applications.
  - Cost-effective approach to software development.
- Importance of Careful Reuse:
  - Reuse should be done with caution.
  - Inappropriate reuse can lead to software errors.
- Example:
  - Therac-25 accidents caused by inappropriate reuse of Therac-20 software.
  - Therac-20 software not designed for Therac-25 hardware platform.

# 2.1.2 - Object-Oriented Design Principles
Chief among the principles of the object-oriented approach, which are intended to facilitate the goals outlined above, are the following:
- Modularity
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
## Modularity
- Software Systems Composition:
  - Comprise multiple components that must interact correctly for the system to function properly.
  - Requires well-organised components.
- Modularity:
  - Organising principle dividing software system components into separate functional units.
  - Provides clarity of thought and manageable units.
- Real-world Analogy:
  - House or apartment consisting of interacting units like electrical, heating, plumbing, and structural systems.
  - Organised architect views them as separate modules for clarity and organisation.
- Implementation in Software:
  - Modularity provides a powerful organising framework in software systems.
  - Module: Collection of closely related functions and classes defined in a single source code file.
  - Example: Python standard libraries like math and os modules.
- Benefits of Modularity:
  - Supports goals of robustness, reusability.
  - Increases robustness by facilitating easier testing and debugging of separate components.
  - Bugs can be traced to specific components for isolated fixes.
  - Facilitates software reusability by writing modules in a general way.
  - Particularly relevant in data structure design for abstraction and generality.
## Abstraction
- Abstraction:
  - Distillation of a complicated system to its fundamental parts.
  - Involves naming parts and explaining functionality.
- Abstract Data Types (ADTs):
  - Mathematical model specifying:
    - Type of data stored.
    - Operations supported.
    - Types of parameters for operations.
  - Specifies what each operation does, not how.
  - Collective set of behaviours referred to as the public interface.
- Python's Approach to Abstraction:
  - Duck typing:
    - Objects are assumed to support known behaviours.
    - Run-time error raised if assumptions fail.
    - "When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck."
  - Abstract Base Classes (ABCs):
    - Mechanism for abstract data types.
    - Cannot be directly instantiated.
    - Defines common methods that all implementations must have.
    - Realised by concrete classes inheriting from the ABC and providing method implementations.
  - Python's `abc` module provides formal support for ABCs.
  - Utilises existing abstract base classes from Python's `collections` module for common data structure ADTs and concrete implementations.
## Encapsulation
- Encapsulation:
  - Principle of object-oriented design.
  - Components should not reveal internal details of their implementations.
  - Advantages:
    - Gives freedom to implement component details without concern for external dependencies.
    - Maintains public interface for interaction with other components.
    - Yields robustness and adaptability.
      - Allows implementation details to change without affecting other parts of the program.
      - Easier bug fixing and addition of new functionality with local changes.
- Encapsulation in Python:
  - Loose support.
  - Convention: Names starting with a single underscore (_secret) are assumed nonpublic.
  - Reinforced by omission from automatically generated documentation.
- Approach in the Book:
  - Adhere to encapsulation principle.
  - Clearly distinguish between public aspects and internal details of data structures.
