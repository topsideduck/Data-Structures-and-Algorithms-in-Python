Object-Oriented Paradigm:
  - Actors: Objects
  - Objects are instances of classes.
  - Classes provide a concise and consistent view of objects without revealing inner workings.
  - Class Definition:
    - Specifies instance variables (data members).
    - Specifies methods (member functions) for object execution.
  - Goals and Design Principles:
    - Fulfilment of various goals and design principles discussed in this chapter.

# 2.1.1 - Object-Oriented Design Goals
Software implementations should achieve robustness, adaptability, and reusability.
## Robustness
- Software Development Goals:
  - Correctness:
    - Program produces correct output for all anticipated inputs.
  - Robustness:
    - Ability to handle unexpected inputs gracefully.
    - Critical in life-critical applications to prevent injury or loss of life.
- Example:
  - Therac-25 accidents in the late 1980s.
  - Radiation-therapy machine overdosed six patients due to software errors.
  - Highlighted the importance of robust software in critical systems.
## Adaptability
- Modern Software Applications:
  - Examples: Web browsers, Internet search engines.
  - Large programs used over many years.
- Goals of Quality Software:
  - Adaptability (Evolvability):
    - Ability to evolve over time in response to changing environmental conditions.
  - Portability:
    - Ability to run with minimal change on different hardware and operating system platforms.
- Advantage of Python:
  - Portability provided by the language itself.
## Reusability
- Reusability:
  - Desire for software to be reusable.
  - Same code usable as a component in different systems and applications.
  - Cost-effective approach to software development.
- Importance of Careful Reuse:
  - Reuse should be done with caution.
  - Inappropriate reuse can lead to software errors.
- Example:
  - Therac-25 accidents caused by inappropriate reuse of Therac-20 software.
  - Therac-20 software not designed for Therac-25 hardware platform.
